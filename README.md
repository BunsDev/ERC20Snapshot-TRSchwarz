# EtherscanAPI / Geth
A Go project containing a library blockchain query functionality. When building various trading tools there are isntances where it can take serious lengths of time
to build up the datasets relying on the etherscan API.

This project aims to implement similar transaction calls using both etherscan API and Geth nodes. In a nutshell its a sandbox to compare the speeds of both to help determine
which solution is most appropriate etc.
